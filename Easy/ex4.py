# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98 Then, the output should be: ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98'] ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')


str = input("Enter the comma separated values: ")
str = str.split(",")
print("{} {}".format(str,tuple(str)))
